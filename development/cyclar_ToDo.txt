Continue update of simulation, estimation.

Simulation: check various approaches: filtering, recursive
Add trends a la Lindström & Forchhammer (p. 58, OUP book).
Can such trends be simulated directly with arima.sim?
- ARIMA models with trend? Add trend to AR2 model. See Fromentin et al.
- arima.sim model formulation, mu & Intercept?
- Generation of AR2 data - innovations?
- SETAR (package tsDyn)
- Ricker model with two lags - simulation
- Seasonal AR(2)

Estimation:
-fit ar-model with xreg argument - allow covariates?
-OLS regression, Y-W and GLS?

- The relationship between xt and Rt, and how to fit models with first differenced series.


# Simulate several patches & estimate parameters
# Multiple time series.
# Use gls or lme if possible
# Vector autoregression models? Transfer functions?

A) Correlation structure
- Observations within patch, temporal autocorrelation
	1) Lagged regression with gls, correlation between residuals
	specified as ARMA(2,0) at deepest level
- Observations between patches, spatial autocorrelation (& temporal?)
	1) Same correlation structure for all patches (covariance matrix; general correlation or compund symmetric).
	2) Several structures available (variogram-based)

B) Variance structure
- Variance structure - per patch, specified with weights-argument:
	1) all equal
	2) varIdent
	3) varComb, per series & along time

Q: How can allow for both spatial- and temporal structure in the same analysis?
